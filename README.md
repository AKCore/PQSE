# PQSE
Pokemon Quest Save Editor (user friendly GUI)

(WORK IN PROGRESS)
Current Status: overall de/en/cryption works

A save file can be easily decrypted and then put back with encryption.

(Example work flow: Decrypt save, make changes in a hex editor, encrypt it)


Always have a backup of your savefile!#


Quick Problem I ran into: Not understanding how you can find the correct address (AFAIK the save file is different sized for everyone, because how many Pokemon you have, Items, and so on..) So if anyone could explain this to me, hit me up on Discord: xSillusx#8869 or within the issues tab: https://github.com/xSillusx/PQSE/issues/1
